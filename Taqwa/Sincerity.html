    <section>
        <p>Sincerity is the freeing of one's intentions from all impurities in order to come nearer to <span
                id="Allah">Allah</span>. It is to
            ensure
            that the intentions behind all acts of worship and obedience to <span id="Allah">Allah</span> are
            exclusively for His pleasure. It
            is
            the perpetual contemplation of the Creator, to the extent that one forgets the creation.
            Sincerity is a condition for <span id="Allah">Allah</span>'s acceptance of good deeds performed in
            accordance with the sunnah of the
            Prophet, may <span id="Allah">Allah</span> bless him and grant him peace.<span id="Allah">Allah</span> has
            commanded this in the Qur’an:

        <blockquote>"And they have been commanded to worship only <span id="Allah">Allah</span>, being sincere towards
            Him in their deen and
            true."
            (98:5)</blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>Abu Umama has related that a man once came to the Prophet, may <span id="Allah">Allah</span> bless him and
            grant him peace, and said,
            "What
            of a man who joined us in the fighting, his intention being for fame and booty?" The Prophet said, "He
            receives
            nothing." The man repeated the question three times and each time the Prophet said, "He receives nothing".
            Then
            he
            said, "<span id="Allah">Allah</span> only accepts actions that are intended purely for His pleasure."

            <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>

        </p>

        <p><span id="Name"> Sa'id al-Khudri</span> related that the Prophet (PBUH) said in his khutba during the
            farewell
            pilgrimage, "<span id="Allah">Allah</span>
            will
            bless whoever hears these words and whoever understands them, for it may be that those who pass on this
            knowledge
            are not those who will understand it the best. There are three things concerning which the heart of a
            believer
            should feel no enmity or malice: devoting one's actions to <span id="Allah">Allah</span>, giving counsel to
            the Imams of the
            Muslims,
            and
            being loyal to the majority."

            <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>


            What is meant here is that these three things strengthen the heart, and whoever distinguishes himself in
            them
            will
            have a heart purified from all manner of deceit, corruption, and evil.
            A servant can only free himself from shaytan through sincere devotion, for <span id="Allah">Allah</span>
            tells us in the Qur’an that
            Iblis
            said to Him:
        <blockquote>"Except those of Your servants who are sincere." (38:83)</blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
            It has been related that a righteous man used to say, "O self, be devout and you will be pure." When any
            worldly
            fortune, in which the self finds comfort and towards which the heart inclines, intrudes upon our worship,
            then
            it
            impairs the purity of our efforts and ruins our sincerity. Man is preoccupied with his good fortune and
            immersed
            in
            his desires and appetites; rarely are his actions or acts of worship free of temporary objectives and
            desires of
            this kind. For this reason, it has been said that whoever secures a single moment of pure devotion to <span
                id="Allah">Allah</span>
            in
            his
            life will survive, for devotion is rare and precious, and cleansing the heart of its impurities is an
            exacting
            undertaking.
        </p>
        <p>In fact, devotion is the purifying of the heart from all impurities, whether few or many, so that the
            intention
            of
            drawing nearer to <span id="Allah">Allah</span> is freed from all other motives, except that of seeking His
            pleasure. This can only
            come
            from a lover of <span id="Allah">Allah</span>, who is so absorbed in contemplation of the next world that
            there remains in his heart
            no
            place for the love of this world. Such a person must be devoted and pure in all his actions, even in eating,
            drinking, and answering the calls of nature. With rare exceptions, anyone who is not like this will find the
            door of
            devotion closed in his face.</p>
        <p>The everyday actions of a person who is overwhelmed by his or her love for <span id="Allah">Allah</span> and
            the akhira are
            characterized by
            his love and they are, in fact, pure devotion. In the same way, anyone whose soul is overwhelmed by love for
            and
            preoccupation with this world, or status and authority, will be so overwhelmed by these things that no act
            of
            worship, be it prayer or fasting, will be acceptable, except in very rare cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            The remedy for love of this world is to break the worldly desires of the self, ending its greed for this
            world
            and
            purifying it in preparation for the next world. This will then become the state of the heart and sincere
            devotion
            will become easier to attain. There are a great many actions where a man acts, thinking they are purely
            intended
            for
            <span id="Allah">Allah</span>'s pleasure, but he is deluded, for he fails to see the defects in them.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has been related that a man was used to praying in the first row in the mosque. One day he was late for
            the
            prayer, so he prayed in the second row. Feeling embarrassed when people saw him in the second row, he
            realized
            that
            the pleasure and satisfaction of the heart that he used to gain from praying in the first row were due to
            his
            seeing
            people seeing him there and admiring him for it. This is a subtle and intangible condition and actions are
            rarely
            safe from it. Apart from those whom <span id="Allah">Allah</span> has assisted, few are aware of such
            delicate matters. Those who do
            not
            realize it only come to see their good deeds appearing as bad ones on the Day of Resurrection; they are the
            ones
            referred to in <span id="Allah">Allah</span>'s words:
        <blockquote>"And something will come to them from <span id="Allah">Allah</span> which they had never
            anticipated, for the evil of their
            deeds will become apparent to them.” (39:47-48)</blockquote>

        And also:

        <blockquote>"Say: Shall We tell you who will lose most in respect of their deeds? Those whose efforts were
            astray in
            the life of this world, while they thought that they were doing good works." (18:103-104)</blockquote>
        </p>
        <p><span id="Name">Yaqub
            </span> said: "A devout person is someone who conceals things that are good, in the same way that he
            conceals
            things that are bad."</p>
        <p><span id="Name">As-Sousi</span> said: "True devotion is to lose the faculty of being conscious of your
            devotion; for
            someone who
            identifies devotion in his devotion is a person whose devotion is in need of devotion." To contemplate
            devotion
            is to admire it, and admiration is an affliction, and that which is pure is whatever is free of all
            afflictions.
            This means that one's deeds should be purified from any self-admiration concerning the actions they entail.
        </p>

        <p><span id="Name">Ayub</span> said: "It is much harder for the people of action to purify their intentions than
            it is to
            execute any
            of
            their actions." Some people have said: "To be devout for a short while is to survive forever, but devotion
            is
            rare."</p>
        <p><span id="Name">Suhail</span> was asked: "What is the most difficult thing for the self? He said: "Devotion
            when the
            self does not
            have
            the good fortune of being endowed with it."</p>
        <p><span id="Name">Al-Fudayl</span> said: "Forsaking action for the sake of other people is to seek their
            admiration. To
            act for the
            sake
            of their admiration is to associate others with <span id="Allah">Allah</span>. Devotion is when <span
                id="Allah">Allah</span> frees you from both of these
            states."</p>
